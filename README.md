## Overview

The **ThibEquation Framework** is a rigorous, quantitative methodology for analyzing interstellar objects using standardized scientific protocols. Developed by **Thibodeau Innovations**, this framework provides researchers with tools to systematically evaluate anomalous astronomical phenomena.

### Key Features

- **ThibScore**: Quantitative scoring system (0-30 scale) for interstellar object significance
- **IOSS Classification**: Interstellar Object Significance Scale (IOSS-1 through IOSS-7+)
- **Mathematical Foundation**: Based on observable data, standardized protocols, and reproducible mathematics
- **Practical Applications**: Validated on 1I/ʻOumuamua, 2I/Borisov, and 3i/ATLAS case studies

## Repository Contents

This repository contains the official documentation and resources for the ThibEquation Framework v4.0, including:

- Framework documentation (HTML format)
- Executive summaries and NDA-protected materials
- Corporate architecture documentation
- Protection and licensing information
- Medium article on 3i/Atlas analysis

## Mathematical Foundation

### ThibScore Formula

```
ThibScore = (A + I + R + U + C) × P / 30
```

Where:
- **A** = Anomaly level (observational deviation from models)
- **I** = Scientific importance and impact potential
- **R** = Reproducibility across multiple observations
- **U** = Uniqueness within known object populations
- **C** = Conventionality (conformity to established physics)
- **P** = Parsimony (simplicity of best explanation)

### IOSS Classification Scale

- **Score 0.00-0.30**: IOSS-1-2 (Routine monitoring)
- **Score 0.30-0.70**: IOSS-3-4 (Enhanced observation)
- **Score 0.70-0.95**: IOSS-5-6 (Priority investigation)
- **Score 0.95-1.00**: IOSS-7+ (Emergency response)
